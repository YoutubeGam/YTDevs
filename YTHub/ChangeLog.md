GUI loading screen, it will still be fast, we don't have many functions involved.<br/>
Error screen, if this happens, just copy it and send it to me. <br/>
This is a warning, my Drawing system will be changed, the only game affected will be Project Lazarus.<br/>
If the updates are already delayed, now they will go more, I want to update, fix and add some things that are missing from the UI.<br/>
King Legacy, im studying getconnections and virtualuser function works, im creating my own firesignal system, soon it will be better. i still don't know the cause, but something is making the server laggy.<br/>
